Password Generator for Unit 3

As alerted when opening the browser, the user will enter a numerical value of how long they'd like their password to be. The user will then select if they want to include the following:
  *Numbers
  *Special Characters
  *Uppercase Letters
  *Lower Case Letters
  
The random password will then be generated into the box on the page. Users will then be able to copy the randomly generated password into the clipboard.
